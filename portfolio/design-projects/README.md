## Design Philosophy

> "I can spend hours perfecting tiny design details — because micro-interactions matter!"

My approach to design focuses on:

- **Accessibility**: Inclusive design for all users
- **Consistency**: Systematic approach to design elements
- **Innovation**: Exploring new patterns while maintaining usability
